## Purpose

- This assignment helps you review some of the basic concepts from Discrete Math / Data Structures course(s) that you may have taken elsewhere than USF.
- It's strongly recommended that you attempt this assignment before the beginning of the fall semester, so as for you to gauge what you will need to review before the class (CS673) begins.
- If you can't solve or answer some of the questions, that's OK, but knowing which one(s) you can't solve/answer will be helpful for you so that you can focus on a specific area.


## Contents

- **Coding Exercises**: There are 4 simple tasks (with unit tests), which assess your understading of recursive/iterative methods, use of data structures, and basic combinatorics/probability.
- **Quiz Questions**: These quiz-style questions are intended to assess your understanding of discrete math in general.
