- Mathematical Proofs
  - Direct Proof 
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.1
  - Proof by contrapositive 
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.2
  - Proof by contradiction 
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.2, Theorem 2.3, and Theorem 2.4
    - Reference (MCS): Section 1.8
  - Proof by cases and counterexamples
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.5, Claim 2.6, Claim 2.7, and Claim 2.8
    - Reference (DS, optional): Theorem 2.9 and Theorem 2.10
    - Reference (MCS): Section 1.7
  - Proof by induction
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.11, Claim 2.12, and Claim 2.13 
    (Note: the statement in Claim 2.12 contains a typo, as the RHS should be `2^{|S|}`, which means that the term on RHS is a power of 2 whose exponent is `|S|`.)
    - Reference (DS): Theorem 2.17 and Theorem 2.18.
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.19 (strong induction)
    - Reference (DS, optional): Theorem 2.14, Theorem 2.15, and Theorem 2.16
- Counting    
  - Product and Sum Rule
    - Reference (DS): Examples 4.1 - 4.6
  - Permutations and Combinations
    - Reference (DS): Definition 4.7, Theorem 4.8, Example 4.9, Definition 4.10, Theorem 4.11, Example 4.12, Example 4.13, and Example 4.14
- Probability
  - Random Variables
    - Reference (DS): Definition 5.25, Definition 5.26, Example 5.27, and Definition 5.28
  - Expectation and Linearity of Expectation
    - Reference (DS): Definition 5.29, Claim 5.30, Example 5.31, and Example 5.32
    - Reference (DS): Theorem 5.33 and Example 5.34
