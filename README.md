- Mathematical Proofs
  - Direct Proof 
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.1
  - Proof by contrapositive 
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.2
  - Proof by contradiction 
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.2, Theorem 2.3, and Theorem 2.4
  - Proof by cases and counterexamples
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.5, Claim 2.6, Claim 2.7, and Claim 2.8
    - Reference (DS, optional): Theorem 2.9 and Theorem 2.10
  - Proof by induction
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.11, Claim 2.12, and Claim 2.13 (Note: the statement in Claim 2.12 contains a typo, as the RHS should be `2^{|S|}`, which means that the term on RHS is a power of 2 whose exponent is `|S|`.)
    - Reference (DS): Theorem 2.17 and Theorem 2.18.
    - Reference (DS): Claim 2.19 (strong induction)
    - Reference (DS, optional): Theorem 2.14, Theorem 2.15, and Theorem 2.16
